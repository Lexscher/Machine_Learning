## Get the dataset

So, Right off the bat, we're given a dataset about customers. This has four columns:
Country, Age, Salary, & Purchased (I _guess_ this is a [(string/varchar), integer, integer, boolean] kind of situation. Dunno, could be wrong!), with ten rows.

The first three columns are _Independent Variabls_ whereas the last column is a _Dependent Variable_. The goal is to use the information from _independent variables_ to predict the outcome/value of _dependent variables_.

## Importing the libraries

There are three libraries that we'll most likely import each time we start a project:

1.  numpy - helps us with math & calculations
2.  matplotlib - helps us plot charts
    (However, we'll key into the extension with dot notation)
    matplotlib.pyplot
3.  pandas - helps us with dataset importing & management

##### With R, the libraries are already imported, so we're good on that part.

## Importing the datasets

##### Python

We can use the file to set our working directory. We'll look into the

Here's an example of us importing the first three columns of the dataset:
![import datasets](./images/import_dtasets1.png)

![import datasets 2](./images/import_dtasets2.png)
