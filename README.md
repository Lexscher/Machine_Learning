# R Notes

I'm taking a Udemy course to learn machine learning, and the course teaches you both Python and R. I think I'll just take notes during the sections on R, Here. This was I can focus on machine learning with python.
Then, I'll go back and do all the sections in R.

These are some things you might need if you're plan to start learning R, as well.

## I will be putting more general ML notes in this repository, as well.

#### Thank you for tanking an interest in my code.

### Best,
