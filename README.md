# Machine Learning Learning

I'm taking a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview) to learn machine learning, and the course teaches you both Python and R. They also provide us with quite a few resources, like the Machine Learning A-Z Template folder I've just added to this repository.

I'll take notes in the md files, and anything that I'll need to code will be in the Machine Learning A-Z Temp. folder. I'll try to keep this repo as clean as I can. I believe that this _may_ end up being my largest repository, yet! Bare with me.

~~I'll just take notes during the sections on R This was I can focus on machine learning with python.
Once I've gotten to the end of the course, I'll go back and do all the sections in R.~~
Ok, curiosity got the better of me. I'll be learning R at the same time as Python from now on... ðŸ˜…

These are some things you might need if you're plan to start learning R, as well:

#### [TO DOWNLOAD R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

#### [TO DOWNLOAD RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

_I take these notes to have a better understanding of the lessons. You may look over them if you'd like to get a better understanding of my thought process while learning.
Please, reach out to me if you have any questions._

#### Thank you for taking an interest in my code.

### Best,
